# My message to the Marble Collective 
I have been experimenting with the backend and bug-hunting for quite some time now. I never wanted to cause any harm, just some tomfoolery :)

Now that I'm banned, I have something to ask the  the collective: 

I have been stockpiling exploits and bugs for months, not all caused by the buggy backend, some are "me pushing the boundaries of intended behaviour", most of which can't be fixed without breaking existing applications (such as VillieOlof's leaderboard).
I may publish them if I'm not unbanned , even if some may have the same impact as EternalBlue did to Windows PCs.

I made a private server for "trusted people". To join. DM me.

## Read this
I'm no longer going to continue this madness. I've learnt from my errors and I won't do them again. I'm not going to leak :)

## Final thoughts
I'm still unhappy with how the situation was handled by the collective, as I was never notified in any way. I'm actually unsure about when and exactly why I was (officially) banned, as the only way to see it is using the API. This makes me believe that bans were specially implemented for me and some other bug abusers (such as @XPower7125, my friend).
