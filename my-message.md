# My message to the Marble Collective 
I have been experimenting with the backend and bug-hunting for quite some time now. I never wanted to cause any harm, just some tomfoolery :)

Now that I'm banned, I have something to ask the  the collective: 

I have been stockpiling exploits and bugs for months, not all caused by the buggy backend, some are "me pushing the boundaries of intended behaviour", most of which can't be fixed without breaking existing applications (such as VillieOlof's leaderboard).
I may publish them if I'm not unbanned , even if some may have the same impact as EternalBlue did to Windows PCs.

I made a private server for "trusted people". To join. DM me.

I'm no longer going to continue this madness. I've learnt from my errors and I won't do them again. I'm not going to leak :)
